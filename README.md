- 👋 Hi, My name is  Veer Patel and I am currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Informatics, specialized in Human-Centered Data Science, Risk Management and Computer Science.
- 👀 I am passionate about several different topics which include, but are not limited to, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, natural language processing, computer science, statistics, data science and business intelligence. I specialize in using data analysis methods to extract valuable insights from raw datasets.
- 🌱 Currently, I am sharpening my coding skills in Python, R, and SQL (with visualizations in tableau) through HackerRank and by actively acquiring various datasets that captivate my curiosity. Through meticulous data analysis, I strive to derive meaningful insights from these datasets that could potentially help individuals or businesses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing Projects. I would collaborate on any type of coding project as well.
- 📫 I would love to connect. Please feel free to reach out : @veer.patel@utexas.edu
- Check out my Github repositories to witness my Personal Projects in action!
- ⚡ Fun fact: A fun fact about me is I am very passionate about Soccer. I have represented my state on the national level and I have been the captain of my Intramural Team for the past four seasons.
